  =========== significant revisions ============

  v 0.0.0.5 Largely due to prodding from:
      jmccarty@sun1307.ssd.usa.alcatel.com (Mike Mccarty Sr)
  I have come to the conclusion that a hshdelete function is
  implementable.  It has been added. This also requires that
  a 'hdeleted' value be added to the status.
  The table actually holds hentries-hdeleted active entries.
